Black Trench
===============
Black Trench is a visualization inspired by the Inverse Square rule that is often seen in nature.

In this space, height (Y) has an inverse square relationship with width (X) [(0,0) being the center of the screen]. X (width) and Z (depth) on the other hand have a circular relationship forming a disc. This disc has a black trench passing through the center.

This began with my fascination with space. Inverse square proportion governs several gravity/entropy phenomenons. A vortex can be observed by making "y" proportional to the product of "x" and "z".
